# Ruby-Capstone-Project
# My_Linter
My_Linter is a linter that provides feedback if HTML best practices are not met.

## How it works

The Linter is for beginners who are not familiar with the CSS best practices. There are so many recommended practices for CSS but this linter focus on the basic requirement to have a good CSS syntax.

- The Linter checks if doctype is declared at the beginning of the file.
- It checks if meta tag description is declared.
- It checks if head tag is found.
- It checks if body contents are found.
- It checks if ul tag is found.
- It checks if lang attribute is found and that it is not too long.
- It checks that no elements have an inline style
